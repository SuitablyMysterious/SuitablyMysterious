## Me:

I'm a CS student who doesnt seem to understand that sometimes, the simplest route is better than the overcomplicated one. I will often start writing code only to find that the tool I am writing alredy exists in 5 different places. I am quite proficient in python, decent in HTML/CSS and bash, could be much better at JavaScriot  am learning how to write parsers using the lark framework in order to write my own language. I would like to learn rust and many other languages.

## Projects:

### Active Development:

 - [Library System](https://github.com/The-CS-Nerds/Library-System) - A project aiming to create a slightly better book/loan/user management for our library than the one currently in place at the moment - In collaberation with [HippoProgrammer](https://github.com/HippoProgrammer)

### Inactive Development:

- [better-settings](https://github.com/SuitablyMysterious/better-settings) - A project aiming to make [JigglyJeff](https://github.com/JigglyJeff)'s code in MakeCode Arcade slightly simpler - It might not work

### Development Concluded:

- [Financify](https://github.com/SuitablyMysterious/Financify) - An OK CLI that is for the management of finances - *ARCHIVED*

## AI Disclaimer:

I will sometimes use Artificial Intelligence to help refine or brainstorm ideas that I have already thought of. Before including any AI generated content in my code, I will check it for any mistakes and edit where I feel appropriate. I will always check its sources first. In addition, I use AI to find where my code has failed in order to save time. I am aware of the environmental risks of AI and try to use it in moderation. For any AI related projects I do, I will always try the Self Hosted option (where appropriate) first.

- [Hard Fork](https://www.nytimes.com/column/hard-fork) - I am an avid listener and, while I do not agree with all opinions expressed here, I find it interesting to listen to

### Useful Tools:

- `n8n` - I use this for all kinds of automation, you can see the results in the section below
- `tailscale` - I use this as my swiss army knife for hosting, ssh and vpns
