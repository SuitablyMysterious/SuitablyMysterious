I’m a computer science student who sometimes takes the overcomplicated route when a simpler solution would work just as well. More than once, I’ve started building a tool only to discover it already exists in several other GitHub repos. It is still a useful learning exercise though.

I’m proficient in **Python**, comfortable with **HTML/CSS** and **Bash**, working to improve my **JavaScript**, and currently learning to build parsers with the **Lark** framework to create my own programming language (called PRISM).
I also plan to learn **Rust** and other languages in the future (when I have time).

### Contact:

#### People who know me IRL:

How on earth did you find this????

#### People who don't know me IRL:

Comment on one of my repos, tagging me with @SuitablyMysterious or email [contact@suitablymysterious.dpdns.org](mailto:contact@suitablymysterious.dpdns.org) and hope my Cloudflare email forwarding rules work. Also, I admire your enthusiasm for a random developer you found on GitHub.

## Skills:

- **Languages:** Python, HTML/CSS, Bash, Rust (learning)
- **Tools & Platforms:** Git, GitHub, n8n, Tailscale
- **Areas of Interest:** Language design, automation, backend systems

## Projects:

**Note:** these are only the ones listed on github, there are many, many more that I haven't ported yet

### Active Development:
- [Library System](https://github.com/The-CS-Nerds/Library-System) – Improving our library’s book, loan, and user management system to be more efficient than the current one. Developed in collaboration with [HippoProgrammer](https://github.com/HippoProgrammer).
- [Wild Cosmos Roster Builder](https://github.com/the-cs-nerds/wild-cosmos-roster-builder) - A roster builder for the tabletop game Wild Cosmos which is soon to be published (<5y)

### Inactive Development:
- [better-settings](https://github.com/SuitablyMysterious/better-settings) – Simplifying [JigglyJeff](https://github.com/JigglyJeff)’s MakeCode Arcade code. May not be fully functional.

### Development Concluded:
- [Financify](https://github.com/SuitablyMysterious/Financify) – A CLI tool for managing finances. *Archived*.

## AI Disclaimer:

I will occasionally use AI tools (usuallt ChatGPT or Claude) to refine or brainstorm ideas I’ve already developed. Before including AI-generated content, I review it for errors, make adjustments where needed, and verify its sources.  

I also use AI to help identify and debug issues more quickly.  

I am mindful of the environmental impact of AI and aim to use it in moderation and for AI-related projects, I will prioritize self hosted solutions (if my PC can run it) over cloud based solutions.

## Inspirations:

- Open-source software in general
- Modern, niche programming language design
- Cybersecurty and its effect on everyday life
- Podcasts like:
  - [Hard Fork](https://www.nytimes.com/column/hard-fork) - I appreciate their takes on AI and other modern technologies
  - [AvTalk](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/avtalk-aviation-podcast/id1215571407) - I pride myself in being an AvGeek and enjoy how Aviation is evolving along with tec
- [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) - Just hilarious

## Useful Tools:

- `n8n` – My go-to platform for automation
- `tailscale` – My “Swiss Army knife” for hosting, SSH, and VPNs
